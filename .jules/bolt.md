## 2025-07-02 - Optimize ReverseBytesInBytes
**Learning:** `ReverseBytesInBytes` was doing a manual 64-bit byte swap in 14 instructions. This operation is effectively a `bswap` which most architectures have a dedicated instruction for. This is called heavily during neural network evaluation and data encoding.
**Action:** Use compiler intrinsic `__builtin_bswap64` or MSVC equivalent `_byteswap_uint64` instead of manual shifts and masks, turning 14 ops into 1 opcode.

## 2024-07-03 - Pre-allocate vector in search tree root selection
**Learning:** In high-frequency hot paths like the root child selection during search phase (`GetBestRootChildWithTemperature`), the vector allocations such as `cumulative_sums` are dynamically expanding `std::vector`. Since we know the upper bound of edges (`root_node_->GetNumEdges()`), we can pre-allocate it to avoid memory allocations and copying over elements.
**Action:** Always pre-allocate `std::vector` variables with `reserve` in inner loops / heavy methods if the capacity is known upfront to prevent dynamic resizing, especially in tree traversal and search logic.

## 2024-05-13 - [Performance improvement] std::to_string overhead
**Learning:** `std::to_string` causes dynamic string allocations on the heap which is inefficient, especially when building large strings or strings from basic types in tight loops, such as UCI communication or loops.
**Action:** Replace `std::to_string` with `std::to_chars` on stack buffer + `std::string::append` to eliminate dynamic string allocation, particularly in hot paths like `uciloop.cc`.
